# smartScreen
In this project, we want to control the brightness of the mobile phone screen according to the intensity of the ambient light. 
For this, use an LED as a replacement for the phone's screen light. To detect ambient light intensity, 
we use LDR as an ambient light intensity sensor and control the LED light based on the amount of ambient light using PWM. 
Note that the light of the phone screen should not affect the value of the light detection sensor.
